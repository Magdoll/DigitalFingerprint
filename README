 Align pyrosequences an alignment
================================================================

For pyrosequencing, we use the 50,000 bp bacterial 16S rRNA
 seed alignment used by the SILVA database (version 98). The
 alignment can be downloaded at:

http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Silva_reference_files


You can use Mothur's aligner or any aligner to align the pyrosequences
 to the reference alignment. For example, using Mothur the command
 line would be:

mothur > align.seqs(candidate=<sequence filename>, template=silva.bacteria.fasta)

This should generate alignment fasta files with the suffix .align.


================================================================
 Processing aligned pyrosequencing files into DF format
================================================================

To process the aligned fasta files into DF format which can then
 be used to run clustering on, use the python script Pyro.py as
 below:

python Pyro.py -p <filename or pattern> -o <output DF filename>

Each file should be an alignment file (ex: .align file from running Mothur)
 that contains aligned sequences for a single sample. You can either
 run Pyro.py individually for every alignment file then concatenate
 the output .DF files later into a single .DF file, or you can use file
 pattern matching, for example:

python Pyro.py -p testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/*.align \
  -o testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/16Spyro_28F_200seq.DF

This would process all .align files in the directory testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/
 and output each sample's Digital Fingerprint collectively in the output
 file testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/16Spyro_28F_200seq.DF.


================================================================
 Getting sequence coverage from DF files
================================================================

If you used a fixed forward and reverse primer for your sequencing,
 for example, 28F and 519R, then you can use the E.coli positions 28-519
 for your clustering. 

If you are unsure of the sequence coverage and want an estimate of
 what range of E.coli positions to use for clustering, use 
 the get_coverage_from_DF.py script in the scripts/ directory:

python get_coverage_from_DF.py <DF filename>


For example, running:

python scripts/get_coverage_from_DF.py testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/16Spyro_28F_200seq.DF

 would generate a file called 16Spyro_28F_200seq.DF.Ecoli_coverage.txt in the same
 directory as the .DF file that shows you the number of nucleotide coverage
 at every E.coli position. In addition, it would recommend you the position range
 to use for clustering. In the case of 16Spyro_28F_200seq.DF, the recommended
 range is 20-342.


================================================================
 Running clustering on DF files
================================================================

To run clustering on DF (Digital Fingerprinting) files, use the clustering.py
 script and specify the following:

 -f <filename> , which must be a DF format file containing the DF of one or more samples
 -r <E.coli range>, the (1-based) range of E.coli positions to use for clustering, ex: -r 20,342
 -i <Diversity Index to use>, which could either be "Simpson" or "Entropy"
 -d <the output diversity index filename>
 -o <the output clustering tree filename>

For example, to cluster the pyrosequencing DF file we've just generated using
 the recommended E.coli range 20-342:

python clustering.py -f testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/16Spyro_28F_200seq.DF \
                     -r 20,342 \
                     -i Simpson \
                     -d testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/16Spyro_28F_200seq.Simpson20to342.DI.txt \
                     -o testsuite/16Spyro_28F_200seq/16Spyro_28F_200seq.Simpson20to342.tree

 
The output tree file will be written in newick format.
